# SHARE-GO
A Carpool App using Flutter

“SHARE GO”  is an app , that has been developed for all the BMSCE Students.

Almost every day, every hour, thousands of vehicles cross hundreds of miles from various locations without realizing the fact that many of them follow the same route at the same time. Wouldn’t it be great, if there was an App such that when students are travelling to the college from the same route everyday and they have 1-2 seats vacant, then they could use it for real-time ride-sharing and earn some money.  

Less traffic, Less Pollution, Save expenses !
